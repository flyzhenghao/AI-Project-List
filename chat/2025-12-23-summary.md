# Summary of changes — 2025-12-23

- Bumped project version to `v1.5.0`.
- Added two new fields to the project new/edit UI:
  - `web_url` (Website URL) — a URL input; project title links to this URL if present.
  - `notes` — multi-line textarea for freeform notes.
- Updated frontend code in `index.html`:
  - Form HTML and CSS for new inputs.
  - `saveProject`, `editProject`, `openModal` now handle `web_url` and `notes`.
  - `renderProjectCard` now prioritizes `web_url` over GitHub Pages derived URL.
  - i18n translations (`webUrl`, `notes`) added for English and Chinese.
- Added `web_url` and `notes` keys to all projects in `data.json` (kept empty by default).
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` with v1.5.0 entry.
- Created conversation record files under `chat/`.

Next recommended steps (if you want me to continue):
1. Run the site locally and manually test new fields in the UI (open `index.html` in browser).
2. If everything is good, tag the release in git (e.g., `git tag -a v1.5.0 -m "Release v1.5.0"` and push tags).
